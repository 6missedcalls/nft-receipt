# Non-Fungible Token Receipts

This project was based on a simple idea to have non-fungible receipts. The initial goal is to create a receipt between a buyer & seller, this information is also stored in the oracle to create an indexable history for all receipts.

## Goals 

1. Convert this project into a typescript project.
2. Create a front-end decentralized application to create new receipt contracts with ease. 
3. Refine solidity smart contracts. (The code isn't my best work. I had the idea and wanted to the initial idea out and would love collaboration on the project if anyone has interest!)
